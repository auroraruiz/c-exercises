C is a midel level language that originated in the 1970s
One of the most widely used languages in the world

Levels
High: python, java, c#, javascript
Medium: c, c++
Low: asssembly, machine language

Low level languages are:
1. Efficient
2. Close to machine architecture
3. Require less memory
4. FAST

5. Difficult to understand
6. Time consuming to write

High level languages are:
1. Easier to work with
2. Easier to understand
3. Allow for more abstraction

4. Slow
5. Use more memory
6. Difficult to work with low level hardware and systems

Middle level languages act as a bridge between high level sofware and
applications and low level hardware and embeded systems
Most compilers, kernels and os are written in C.
Python is written in C. The default implementation is CPython.

Important notes:
1. C is NOT object oriented. it is procedural, not abstract.
2. C++ is an OO extension of C
3. C is difficult

What you'll need:
1. IDE (text editor)
2. GCC compiler (converts C code into machine code)
